# From Nand to Hack

## The Hack Computer

- Nand:
    - Combination Logic:
    - Elementary Logic Gates
        - Comb. and Seq. Logic:
        - CPU, RAM, chipset
            - Digital Design:
            - Computer architecture
                

## XOR:
Outputs 1 if exactly one of its inputs is 1, otherwise outputs 0

 A | B | out 
---|---|----
 0 | 0 | 1 
 0 | 1 | 0 
 1 | 1 | 1 
 1 | 0 | 0
