# The Road Ahead

The most potant tool is seperate of concerns. Once we can seperate, we can forget a lot of details of implementations and can remember a very clean What without having to have so many things in our mind at the same time.

Then we only have to worry about box X, and when X is done we can start only worrying about box Y.

We start with very basic logic gates -> more complicated chips -> cpu -> 2nd course (Software)

Every week:
- Worry about a single level
- Take the lower level as given
- Implement the Higher level
- Test that it works

At the end of the course we will have a very basic computer with simple logic gates (NAND gates)
